## Overview

This project uses movie ratings and metadata to recommend movies to users based on similarity metrics. The system utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compute recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ipywidgets
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the recommendation system:

```sh
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

Key libraries used:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling.
- `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer` for text vectorization.
- `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity` for computing similarities.

## Files

- `main.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing project code.
- `movies.csv` - Dataset containing movie information.
- `ratings.csv` - Dataset containing user ratings.

## Contributing
